# Web Video Stream Application

this application is about play video in browser

this application is not include the front page, this application only about @RestController

HTTP header matters:
* Request header: generated by bowser automatically or web front applications
  * [Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests): this key means client will request partial of resource, `Range` tells the server which part of resource is needed
* Response header: generated by this application
  * [Accept-Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Ranges): we need to set this key to `bytes`, which tells the client, current server support return partial resource
  * [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type): since we don't get a front page, video will be handled by browser, only .mp4 format can be played automatically, so MIME type is `video/mp4`. to support more formats, you can use some converter, such as [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
  * [Content-Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range): this key indicates which part of resource is returned by server
  * [Content-Length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range): this key represent is size of response body

that is all we need to handle request for video stream
